        <h2>What kind of robots should be made in a reality where manpower problems are occurring due to low birth rates?</h2>
    </div>

South Korea is currently facing a serious labor shortage due to the low birth rate.

Due to the aging population, the proportion of service workers will inevitably increase.

There will also be food shortages due to prolonged labor shortages in rural areas and climate change.  

In order to solve the problems we are facing, the development of robots in related fields will be essential.
